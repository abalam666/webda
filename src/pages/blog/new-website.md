After some improvments since the first version of Webda, it requires a new look for its website.

Thanks to [Electric JS](https://electricjs.com/), we were able to create a whole new website way faster with those cool UI effects.

The same day we are releasing the new website, we also have a fix release **v0.4.6**

This release includes :
 * DynamoDB incrementAttribute with 0 fix
 * Email storage in lower case
 
In the next weeks, as Christmas gift we will work hard on a **v0.5.0** it should includes :
 * Better [WeDeploy](https://wedeploy.com/) integration
 * Easier queue worker deployment
 * [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) integration
 * Static website deployment integration
